# Machine-Learning-Project-Proposal

Dog Breed Classifier

The goal of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds. It will provide the evaluation of an image as a dog or a human, then go on to predict which dog breed the dog is, or which dog breed the human most resembles. If the image is detected as neither a dog nor a human, the classifier will not provide an output.
